        # Details

    attributes:
      label: Is there anything useful in the logs?
      description: >
        By default, Home Assistant shows only logs on levels `error` and `warning`.
        If there is nothing on these levels, you may enable `debug` logging for the integration.
        To do this, add the following YAML code to your `configuration.yaml`

        logger:
          logs:
            custom_components.asusrouter: debug
            asusrouter: debug

        Debug logging highly increases the log file size. Don't keep it on for a long time, if not needed.
